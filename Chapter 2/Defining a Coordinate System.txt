Background
The human body is divided into the 
Human emotion
First things first, life and death are the ultimate human emotions.They are the edges we are using to define the bounadries of existence. *Determine what dimensions they represent.
Cooridinate Ssytem
What is tge sahpe of a perfect human body? Spherical or cylindrical? Sphere is fat person, when you exercise, biceps, muscles look cylindrical. 4 (x, y, z, emotional flux)(FLux is the body surface integral)
Thought experiment
Proof emotions exist in less than 1-dimension or in fractal dimensions
If two people go to the store, and buy the same chair, then take them back home. They have the same chair, however, there chair's conditions will be different. Their positions, conditions are entirely subjective. Emotions are subjective. They are personal chaira existing within us.

Proof exists in less than one dimension
You can see a point(1-d), a line (-2d), a chair(3d), a 4d object, but you can't see emotions
Other things that exist in fractal dimensions - Lightning? magnetism? Electricity? Speed? Light???! 

Interesting thing- when stimulated, <1d things manifest in 3 Dimension
Eg. An electric spark, getting electrocuted, feeling two magnets repel, getting sad till you form a poatato in your neck, red with embarrasment.
