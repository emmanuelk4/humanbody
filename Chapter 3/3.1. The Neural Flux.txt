The neural flux has a value of:
Axioms
1. Thoughts are stored in fractal dimensions, only when the correct neural bridge is formed, can we retrieve memories.
2. Fractal dimensions are subjective, they msut be brought to three dimensional space fro them to be shared.
3. Self awareness/introspection is the ability to interact with these fractal dimensions by forming multiple bridges.
4. Conceptual imaging is proof that these fractal dimensions exist, you can peek into them, especcially when you dream.
5. There is an upper limit to the number of fractal threads you can run. This is why you cannot have many thoughts in your head at once, or, try to store many things in your active memory.
6. People with photographic memory have active bridges to these storage dimensions, they lack the need to form neural bridges.
Definition:
Fractal thread: a single thought process, on among which your brain runs in parallel to others.
